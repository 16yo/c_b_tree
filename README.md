# It's my custom binary tree realization on C lang

B_tree is a binary tree which elements are nodes that may have their  youngest and oldest child, ancestor node, id and exact value.

Feature of my b_tree is that you can easy and fast delete nodes ans subtrees and update information about depth and degree of each node whenever you want to.

After deleting other nodes saves their ids but it doesn't cause any system erros because information about nodes stores in mapswhich can be rebuilt under a new tree.
